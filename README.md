# SUMMARY
This is a tutorial-like place that aim to  be simple but understandable. For me, most of the OpenCV source was complicated at first, so i want to make a simple source explain OpenCV and teach basic but important stuff.  Thank you to  check this out ☺


## WHAT IS AN IMAGE IN IMAGE PROCESSING
Image are not visual element for computer, but matrix of pixels. So computer handle a image as mathematical element.

## LINES AND SHAPES
##### CREATE AN EMPTY SCREEN

``` python
 screen_base = np.zeros((screen_width,screen_height,3), dtype = "uint8") # 3,channel count(B G R) 
 
```
This line of code create an empty screen. Images are multi-dimensional array.  So can create a screen with numpy array without use a image.


 
To be continued, stay tuned :)
