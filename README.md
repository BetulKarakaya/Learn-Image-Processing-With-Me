# Image Processing with Pillow

This project demonstrates basic and advanced image processing techniques using the Python **Pillow** and **OpenCV** libraries. It includes various operations such as resizing, cropping, rotating, flipping, applying filters, converting to grayscale, adding text, accessing pixel data, drawing shapes, and enhancing images. It also includes a **Super Resolution** module to upscale low-resolution images using deep learning models.

## Setup

1. **Install Pillow**:
   You need to install the Pillow library to work with image files.
   💻 Installation (Recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install pillow
   ```
3. **Install OpenCV:**
You need to install the OpenCV (cv2) library with contrib modules to access advanced functionalities like super resolution (DNN module), trackbars, interactive drawing, and edge detection.

💻 Installation (Recommended):
```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

3. **Image Files**: Ensure that you have an image (e.g., [sample.jpg](https://www.pexels.com/tr-tr/fotograf/dinamik-isik-efektleriyle-soyut-portre-31208192/) ) for testing. You can use any image or download one from free image sources like Pexels or Unsplash.

4. **Directory Structure**: The program creates an `edited_images` folder to save all processed images. Ensure the script has permission to create files and folders.

## Usage


1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Place your image file (e.g., [sample.jpg](https://www.pexels.com/tr-tr/fotograf/dinamik-isik-efektleriyle-soyut-portre-31208192/) ) in the project directory.
3. Run the scripts.
   
### 📸 **Basic Image Processing**
```bash
python pillow_basics_github.py
```

The script will:

- Show the original image.
- Perform various transformations on the image and save the results as new files in the **edited_images** folder.

### ✨ **Image Enhancement**
To manipulate brightness, contrast, color levels, and sharpness, run:
```bash
python pillow_enhanced_images_github.py
```
```bash
python open_cv_trackbar_enhancement_github.py
```

The script will:
- Pillow Version:
   - Show the original image.
   - It manipulates the brightness, contrast, color levels, and sharpness of an image and save the results as new files in the **enhanced_images** folder.
- OpenCV version:
  - Display an image in fullscreen mode with interactive controls
  - Provide real-time adjustment of:
     - Contrast (via trackbar, scaled between 0.0 and 2.0)
     - Brightness (via trackbar, scaled between 0 and 100)
     - Gaussian Blur (adjustable blur intensity with odd kernel sizes)
  - Apply all effects live while you adjust the sliders
  - Save the enhanced image by pressing the s key
  - Exit the tool anytime by pressing the ESC key
  - Automatically create an output folder if it doesn't exist
  - Maintain original image untouched; all edits are based on a copy

### 🧠 Super Resolution Module with OpenCV

The `SuperResolution/` folder contains:

- ✅ Low-resolution example image(s)
- ✅ Code to upscale using `cv2.dnn_superres`
- ✅ Pre-trained models (LapSRN, ESPCN, FSRCNN)
- ❌ EDSR models not included due to GitHub file size limits

You can run:

```bash
python SuperResolution/super_resolve.py
```
The script will:
- Load the selected super-resolution model (e.g., ESPCN, LapSRN, or EDSR) in .pb format.
- Read a low-resolution input image from the low_resolution_images folder.
- Automatically detect model scaling factor (e.g., ×2, ×4).
- Upscale the input image using the specified deep learning model.
- Display the original and enhanced images side by side for visual comparison.
- Allow the user to save the enhanced image in the super_resolution_outputs folder by pressing the s key.
- Exit the image display window with the ESC key.

```bash
python open_cv_shapes_text_github.py
```
or

```bash
python pillow_drawings_github.py
```

```bash
python pillow_image_rolling_github.py
```
This script will:

- Resize the image to a specified smaller size.
- Repeatedly paste this resized image to fill the entire original canvas.
- Save the output in the **rolled_image** folder.

### 🖼️ **High-Resolution Image Enhancement**
This script enhances the resolution and quality of low-resolution images using the Pillow library. It applies sharpening, contrast enhancement, and color adjustment to improve image clarity. The enhanced images can be saved with high quality or increased DPI (dots per inch) for better print resolution.

```bash
python pillow_fix_resolution_github.py
```
This script will:

- Enhance image sharpness, contrast, and color vibrancy
- Save the image with maximum quality settings

### 🎨 **Color Change Tool**
This script allows you to **replace specific colors in an image** based on an RGB range. It uses **Pillow** and **NumPy** to detect pixels within a given color range and replace them with a new color. 

```bash
python pillow_color_change_github.py
```

This script will:

- Load the Image – Opens the input image and converts it to **RGBA** format.
- Define the Color Range – Specify the **RGB min-max values** to detect specific colors.
- Apply the Color Change – Replaces pixels in the defined range with a **new RGBA color**.
- Save the Processed Image – Stores the modified image in the `color_changed_image` folder.

```bash
python pillow_batch_image_github.py
```
The script will:
